# Pipeline Simulator

This project is an algorithm that simulates the execution of a **pipeline**, processing a series of instructions. It models the stages of a pipeline and processes tasks as they progress through each stage, demonstrating fundamental concepts of pipeline execution.

## Overview

- **Pipeline Simulation**: Processes a set of instructions as they move through simulated pipeline stages.
- **Educational Tool**: Useful for understanding how pipeline execution works in computing.

This project provides hands-on insight into pipeline processing concepts in computer architecture.
